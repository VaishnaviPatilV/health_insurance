# health_insurance



📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting a person’s medical insurance cost based on their personal and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, and number of children.

The goal is to:
Understand which factors most influence health insurance costs.
Build a predictive machine learning model that can estimate medical charges for new individuals.

✨ Features

Age: The person’s age — older individuals usually have higher costs.
Gender: Male or Female.
BMI (Body Mass Index): Measures body fat; higher BMI often means higher medical costs.
Blood Pressure (bp): An important health indicator.
Children: Number of dependent children covered by the insurance.
Region: Geographic area (northwest, southeast, southwest, etc.).
Smoker: Whether the person smokes or not — the strongest cost factor.
Medical Cost: Actual insurance charge (target variable).
